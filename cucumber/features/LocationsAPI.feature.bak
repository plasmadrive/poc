Feature:  A locations API that retrieves a list of locations starting with two or more characters
  In order to pupulate a locations typeahead list I need to retrieve the locations that start with two characters
         
  Scenario Outline:  Retrieve a list of locations whose name begins with  <chars> for a Maersk group brand <<brand>>
    Given the locations API deployed on <host>
    And <chars> is two characters at the start of a location name
    When I perform a GET on the <hots>/locations URL
    And the query parameter LocationNamePrefix is equal to <chars>
    And the query parameter Brand is equal to <<brand>>
    Then I receive an HTTP 200 response
    And the Content-Type is application/json
    And the
    And the JSON should look like """ 
    [
       {"GeoId" : "xxxx",
       "DisplayName" : "<chars>RestOfCityName StateName CountryName",
       "LocationType" : "CY or empty"
      }
      ]

# The scenarios below are test scenarios to test functionality of the API gateway during a POC / Trial phase
Scenario Outline: Requests from an IP address <aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd> are rejected
  Given the locations API exposed on the API Gateway
  But the gateway has a policy has a policy to reject requests from <aaa.bbb.ccc.dddd> to /locations
  When I perform a GET on the /locations URL
  And the query parameter has at least two characters
  Then I receive an HTTP 403 response


Scenario Outline: Requests from a customer with code <XYZ> are limited to <x> calls per second
  Given the locations API is exposed on the API Gateway
  And I have a customer code of <XYZ> 
  And I have authenticated with Azure AD via the Open ID Connect service
  And I have made <x> requests to the /locations URL in the last second
  But the API gateway has a policy configured to throttle requests with Customer Code <XYZ> to <x> calls per second
  When I make a GET request to the /locations API
  Then I receive a HTTP 200 response
  And the HTTP Content-Type is application/json
  But the response will be delayed
